## From Web to Assembly

Hello! My name is **Oliver**. With **one year of experience** in **software testing** and another in **IT Help Desk**, I've gained a **broad understanding** of technology from a practical perspective. However, my true **passion** lies in the **deeper realms** of computing technology.

My **tech journey started** in high school with learning **Java**, then continued in **college** with **web programming**, where I learned the **fundamentals** of **JavaScript, HTML, CSS,** and **PHP**. This foundation, though exciting, left me **yearning for more insight** into how computers function beyond the **abstractions** of **web development**. 

My **curiosity** led me to explore **how assembly language operates**, which is a step closer to the **machine code** that directly controls **hardware**. This led me to study the **6502 processor**, which is a **popular chip** from the **1970s** known for its **affordability** and **strong performance**. I continue to apply this knowledge in **developing games** for the **NES**, exploring the capabilities of the **6502 processor**.

I am now delving into **questions** like how **data** is stored in **SSDs**, what **memory addresses** are, the fundamentals of **binary**, and the **role of transistors** in computingâ€”all driven by a desire to program at the **lowest levels**. Each day, I am committed to expanding my **knowledge of computers**, aiming to **bridge the gap** between **high-level** software and the **underlying hardware** that powers our **digital world**.
